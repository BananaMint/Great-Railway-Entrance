As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

Response
====

1. Disagree.

2. List areas where humans excel and areas where machines do better, so in those areas where people clearly outperform machines, the statement is false:
    1. Points for humans:
        Writing a novel
        Paint a portrait
        Develop a new theory
        Invent new algorithms
    2. Points for machines:
        Repetitive works such as arithmetic
        Problems extremely large in scale such as collecting and processing urban traffic data
        Assembly line robots

3. In many ways, technology frees human from various forms of manual labor, so people can concentrate more on the creative parts. Technology and humans are complementary.
    1. When designing a new product, focus more on functionality and accessibility instead of whether it is possible to realize and manufacture such design.
    2. Because of the development of numerical computation, physicists can focus on models and thesis without spending time doing manual numerical calculations like Gauss.

4. If technology can reasonably outperform humans in solving certain problems, than there is no compelling reason to demand these problems be solved by human independently. Arthur C. Clarke famously said: "Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be!", on a similar note, any problems that can be solved by a machine should be. ...

5. Conclusion. Despite the fear induced by various science fiction movies about robots overtaking humans, I believe this won't happen any time soon, at least not in this millennium. We may not know our creator, but even if we can reasonably suspect that robots have consciousness, they will definitely know their creator. The true independence of human minds lie not in the capacity to solve problems, but in the creative process of comming up with such problems, and the process of finding novel approaches to these problems.
